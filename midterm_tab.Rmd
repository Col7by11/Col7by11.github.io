## Instruction

The midterm has two components: the Rmarkdown notebook (html) and the presentation.  We will do the presentation in class. Post both the notebook and the presentation on your Github page. 

**The notebook:** The notebook should be created using `rmarkdown` (like other assignments). The notebook should have a title. It should have a table of content (TOC form) or in a tab form. The Rmd files of Tab and Toc form are available on the class webpage. 

**The Presentation:** Present your results in 5-10 minutes. To make the presentation using Rmarkdown, do the follows: 

    - In Rstudio -> File -> New File -> R markdown
    
    - In the left panel, click to Presentation -> Click OK
    
    - Now you have an Rmarkdown that can be knitted to be a html presentation 
    
- You can also use Rmd samples of the class slides that are available on the class webpage. 
    
- You do not need to rerun all the codes for the presentation. For example, to show the model comparison, you just need to show the image of the model comparison instead of running all the models again.
    
- To inset an image in a slide, use  `![](image.png)`

- To scale images, you can follow these below instructions. 
    
    - https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/figure-size.html
    
    - http://zevross.com/blog/2017/06/19/tips-and-tricks-for-working-with-images-and-figures-in-r-markdown-documents/

- To turn off message and warning of a code cell, use:  `{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}` for the cell. 

**What to present**:

  - Present Part 2 - Visualization
  
  - Present Question Question 4, 5 and 6 in Part 3.  
  
  - Present any errors/challenges you run into and how you fix/overcome them. 

**Data:**  

The data for the mid-term project is the Rhode Island Department of Health Hospital Discharge Data.  Each row of the data presents a patient.

## I. Data Wranggling

1. Download the data file `hdd0318cy.sas7bdat`.  

2. Use `read_sas` in library `haven` to read the data. 
```{r}
library(haven)
df <- read_sas('C:\\Users\\student\\OneDrive - Bryant University\\Desktop\\R\\Col7by11.github.io\\hdd0318cy.sas7bdat')
```
    
3. Filter the data to have only patients of the year 2018 (`yod=2018`)
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
df <- df %>% filter(yod==18)
```
    
4. Select to work with only following variables: 

```{r}
df <- df %>% select(yod,payfix, pay_ub92, age, sex, raceethn, provider, moa, yoa, mod, admtype, asource, preopday, los, service, icu, ccu, dispub92, payer, drg, trandb, randbg, randbs, orr, anes, seq, lab, dtest, ther,blood,phar,other,patcon,bwght,total,tot,ecodub92,b_wt,pt_state,diag_adm,ancilar, campus,er_fee,er_chrg,er_mode,obs_chrg,obs_hour,psycchrg,nicu_day)
```
 

*Notice*:  You may want to save the current data to your computer for easy access later.  To save the data file use `write_csv(df, 'midterm.csv')`, for example.  
```{r}
write_csv(df, 'midterm_csv')
```

5. What are variables that have missing values?
```{r}
colSums(is.na(df))
```
 
6. Remove all variables with missing values. 
```{r}
df <- df %>% select(-payfix, -preopday, -obs_hour, -nicu_day)
```
 
7. Refer to the data description in the file `HDD2015-18cy6-20-19.docx`, which variable recording the month of admission?, which variable recording the month of discharge?
```{r}
##Month of Admission is moa##
##Month of Discharge is mod##
```

8. Which month admitted the most number of patients? Which month admitted the most number of male patients?
```{r}
df %>% 
  count(moa) %>% 
  arrange(-n)
##October admitted the most number of patients##
df %>% 
  filter(sex=='1') %>% 
  count(moa) %>% 
  arrange(-n)
##October admitted the most number of male patients##
```

9. Which month has the most number of teenage female patients?
```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(sex=='2', age>='13'& age<='19') %>% 
  count(moa) %>% 
  arrange(-n)
##March has the most number of teenage female patients##
```

10. Which provider has the most number of female patients in October? 
```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(sex=='2', moa=="10") %>% 
  count(provider) %>% 
  arrange(-n)
##Provider 7205, Rhode Island Hospital, has the most number of females in October##
```

11. Are female patients older than male patients, on average? 
```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarise(average_age = mean(age)) %>% 
  arrange(-average_age)
##Male patients are older on average##
```

12. Calculate the average age of patients by months. Which month has the oldest patients on average age?
```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(moa) %>% 
  summarise(average_age = mean(age)) %>% 
  arrange(-average_age)
##January has the oldest average age##
```

13. What is the name of the provider that has the highest total charge?
```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(provider) %>% 
  summarise(average_tot = mean(tot)) %>% 
  arrange(-average_tot)
##Provider 7215, Bradley, has the highest total charge##
```

14. What is the name of the provider that has the least total charge for teenage male on average?
```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(provider) %>% 
  filter(sex=='1', age>='13'& age<='19') %>% 
  summarise(average_tot = mean(tot)) %>% 
  arrange(average_tot)
##Provider 7206, Roger Williams, has the least total charge for teenage males on average##
```

15. Create a season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter) variable. Calculate the length of stays by season.  Which season has the longest length of stays on average?
```{r}
df$season <- case_when(df$moa>=3 & df$moa < 6 ~ 'Spring', df$moa >= 6 & df$moa <9 ~'Summer', df$moa>= 9 & df$moa <12~  'Fall', TRUE ~ 'Winter')

df %>% 
  group_by(season) %>% 
  summarise(average_los = mean(los)) %>% 
  arrange(-average_los)
##Summer has the longest length of stay on avg##
```

16. On average, how much a 20 year-old male get charged for staying 1 day in the Fall season?
```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(sex=='1', age=='20', season=='Fall', los=='1') %>% 
  summarise(average_tot = mean(tot)) %>% 
  arrange(average_tot)
##A 20 year-old male would spend on average about $16,511 for 1 day in the Fall"
```

17. Write a paragraph to summarize the section and give your comments on the results. You could do some other calculations to support your points. 
```{r}
##In the data wrangling section I used the functions group_by, filter, summarise when find the means, arrange, and case when when assigning the season variable.  October tends to be the month where most people are admitted, and the admitted people tend to be older and are females.  Older people tend to be more often admitted in January though.  Summer has the longest length of stay.  Bradley has the highest charge of all providers.##
```

## II. Data Visualization

Continue with the data from part I. 

1. Provides at least 10 meaningful plots. Comments on the plots. All plots should have title, caption, appropriate labels on x and y-axis
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

df %>% ggplot()+
  geom_density(mapping = aes(x = age)) +
  labs(x="Age", y="Density", title = "Age Distribution", caption="Most common ages admitted") 
##It is more common that people in their 60s are admitted##

df %>% ggplot()+
  geom_density(mapping = aes(x = age, color=provider))+
  labs(x="Age", y="Density", title = "Age Distribution by Provider", caption="What ages are most common for each provider") 
##Bradley admits the youngest population among the providers##

df %>% ggplot()+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = pt_state))+
  labs(x="State of Patient", y="Count", title = "State Location of Patients Distribution", caption="Which states have the most people admitted") 
##Rhode Island is the most common state with Massachusetts in second with two other states showing data##

df %>% ggplot()+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = sex))+
  labs(x="Sex", y="Count", title = "Sex Distribution", caption="Gender most commonly admitted") 
##Female is the most common admitted##

df %>% ggplot()+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = provider))+
  labs(x="Provider", y="Count", title = "Provider Distribution", caption="Most commonly used provider") 
##The most commonly used provider is Rhode Island Hospital##

df %>% ggplot()+geom_point(aes(x=age, y=tot))+
  labs(x="Age", y="Total Chargers", title = "Chargers by Age", caption="Ages with the highest amount of charges") 
##Younger people tend to have more extreme charges##

df %>% ggplot()+geom_point(aes(x=age, y=los))+
  labs(x="Age", y="Length of Stay", title = "Length of Stay by Age", caption="Ages with the longest stays") 
##Length of stay is typically longer for people around the age 30##

df %>% ggplot()+
  geom_bar(mapping=aes(x=sex, fill=provider), position = 'fill')+
  labs(x="Sex", y="Count", title = "Provider Used by Sex", caption="Most commonly used providers by each sex")
##This shows the most common providers among each gender##

df %>% ggplot()+
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = age, y = sex))+
  labs(x="Age", y="Sex", title = "Age by Sex", caption="Ages of admitted patients by sex") 
##This plot shows the distribution of ages for males and females##

df %>% ggplot()+geom_smooth(aes(x=age, y=tot))+
  labs(x="Age", y="Total Chargers", title = "Chargers by Age", caption="Ages with the highest amount of charges") 
##There's a greater spread as people get older##
```

2. Make an animation plot. 
```{r}
library(gganimate)
df %>% ggplot()+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = sex)) + transition_states(age) +
  labs(x="Sex", y="Count", title = "Sex Distribution by Age", caption="Gender most commonly admitted for each age") 
```

3. Write a paragraph to summarize the section and give your comments on the results. 
```{r}
##In this section, I created different graphs such as bar plots, scatter plots, box plots, etc. to represent information on the data.  I also created animations and labels for the graphs.  Some of the important information the graphs tell us are the most common age of admittance is people in their 60s, females are most commonly admitted with Rhode Island hospital admitting the most people, but Bradley admits the youngest people.##
```

## III. Predictive Models

Continue with the data from part I. Make sure you do not have any missing values in the data. Use the follows as the target and input variables: 

*Target Variable*: Create the target variable taking value of 

  - `low` if the total charge of a patient (`tot`) is smaller than the median of the total charge, and

  - `high` otherwise. 

*Input Variables*:

  - "age","sex","raceethn","provider","moa","mod","admtype","campus", 'los'
  
-------

1. Use `filter` function to filter out rows where `raceethn==''` or `admtype==''`. Make sure all the categorical variables are factor, numeric variables are numeric. Set Training : Testing Split = 10 : 90 
```{r}
library(caret)
df <- read_csv('midterm_csv')
df <- df %>% filter(raceethn!='', admtype!='')
df$tot2 <- ifelse(df$tot<median(df$tot),'low', 'high')
df <- df %>% 
  mutate(target = as.factor(tot2),
         sex = as.factor(sex),
         raceehtn = as.factor(raceethn),
         campus = as.factor(campus),
         moa = as.factor(moa),
         mod = as.factor(mod),
         admtype=as.factor(admtype))
df <- df %>% 
  mutate(age = as.numeric(age),
         los = as.numeric(los))
df <- df %>% select(target,age,sex,raceethn,provider,moa,mod,admtype,campus,los)
set.seed(2020)
splitIndex <- createDataPartition(df$target, p = .90, list=FALSE)
df_train <- df[ splitIndex,]
df_test <- df[-splitIndex,]
```

2. Train a decision tree using `rpart`.  Plot the decision tree. Plot the variable importance ranked by the tree. 
```{r}
library(rpart)
tree_model <- rpart(target ~ ., data = df_train,
                 control = rpart.control(maxdepth = 3))
library(rattle)
fancyRpartPlot(tree_model)
tree_model$variable.importance
barplot(tree_model$variable.importance)
```

3. Using caret for this question. Set `Training Control` to be: Use Cross-Validation of 5 folds across all models.  Train & tune at least 2 different models (i.e. two different values for `method=` in the train function of caret).  Plot the hyper-parameter tuning plots for each model. 
```{r}
tuneGrid = expand.grid(maxdepth = 2:10)
trControl = trainControl(method = "cv",
                         number = 5)
tree_approach2 <- train(target~., data=df_train, 
                  method = "rpart2", trControl                        =trControl, tuneGrid = tuneGrid)
plot(tree_approach2)
trControl1 = trainControl(method = "cv",
                         number = 5)
tuneGrid1 = expand.grid(mtry = 2:4,
          splitrule = c('gini', 'extratrees'),
           min.node.size = c(2:5))
forest_ranger <- train(target~., data=df_train, 
                    method = "ranger", 
                    trControl = trControl1,
                    tuneGrid = tuneGrid1)
plot(forest_ranger)
```

4. Plot the comparison of the models in 3. 

```{r}
results <- resamples(list('Decision Tree' = tree_approach2,'Random Forest' = forest_ranger))

bwplot(results)
```

5. What is your final selection for the model? Test the accuracy of your final model on the test data. 
```{r}
##Final selection for the model is the tree model##
pred1 <- predict(tree_approach2, df_test)
cm1 <- confusionMatrix(data = pred1, reference = df_test$target)
cm1$overall[1]
```

6. Create another `target` variable (binary), decide the input variables and redo 1 to 5. 
```{r}
df <- read_csv('midterm_csv')
df <- df %>% filter(raceethn!='', admtype!='')
df$los2 <- ifelse(df$los<mean(df$los),'low', 'high')
df <- df %>% 
  mutate(target = as.factor(los2),
         sex = as.factor(sex),
         raceehtn = as.factor(raceethn),
         campus = as.factor(campus),
         moa = as.factor(moa),
         mod = as.factor(mod),
         admtype=as.factor(admtype))
df <- df %>% 
  mutate(age = as.numeric(age),
         los = as.numeric(tot))
df <- df %>% select(target,age,sex,raceethn,provider,moa,mod,admtype,campus,los)
set.seed(2020)
splitIndex <- createDataPartition(df$target, p = .90, list=FALSE)
df_train <- df[ splitIndex,]
df_test <- df[-splitIndex,]

tree_model1 <- rpart(target ~ ., data = df_train,
                 control = rpart.control(maxdepth = 3))
fancyRpartPlot(tree_model1)
tree_model1$variable.importance
barplot(tree_model$variable.importance)

tuneGrid = expand.grid(maxdepth = 2:10)
trControl = trainControl(method = "cv",
                         number = 5)
tree_approach3 <- train(target~., data=df_train, 
                  method = "rpart2", trControl                        =trControl, tuneGrid = tuneGrid)
plot(tree_approach3)
trControl1 = trainControl(method = "cv",
                         number = 5)
tuneGrid1 = expand.grid(mtry = 2:4,
          splitrule = c('gini', 'extratrees'),
           min.node.size = c(2:5))
forest_ranger1 <- train(target~., data=df_train, 
                    method = "ranger", 
                    trControl = trControl1,
                    tuneGrid = tuneGrid1)
plot(forest_ranger1)

results <- resamples(list('Decision Tree' = tree_approach3,'Random Forest' = forest_ranger1))

bwplot(results)

##Final selection for the model is the tree model##
pred2 <- predict(tree_approach2, df_test)
cm2 <- confusionMatrix(data = pred2, reference = df_test$target)
cm2$overall[1]
```

7. Write a paragraph to summarize the section and give your comments on the results. 
```{r}
##In this section I used rattle, caret, and rpart libraries.  These helped me create target variables, training and testing data, trees and forests, and comparing variable importance as well as accuracies. I found that my trees had the highest testing accuracy of about .8 for the target variable of tot2.##
